1> What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans : Python boolean type is one of the built-in data types provided by Python, which represents one of the two values i.e.True or False.

2> What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans : There are only 2 types of boolean operators True and False.

3>Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans:Operator A	Operator B	Logical AND result
	True		True	        True
	True		False		False
	False		True		False
	False		False		False

Operator A	Operator B	Logical OR Result
	True	True		True
	True	False		True
	False	True		True
	False	False		False

Operator A	Logical NOT Result
	True	False
	False	True

4> What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) =False
not (5 > 4) =False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) =True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))=False
(True and True) and (True == False) =False
(not False) or (not True) =True

5> What are the six comparison operators?
Ans:We have six of these, including and limited to- 
less than, (<)
greater than, (>)
less than or equal to,(<=) 
greater than or equal to, (>=)
equal to, (==)
and not equal to(!=)

6> How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.

Ans: The “=” is an assignment operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. 
The '==' operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If so, it returns true

x=10
y=20
z=20

(x==y) is False because we assigned different values to x and y.

(y==z) is True because we assign equal values to y and z.

(x=10) is assignment of value 10 to x.

7> Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0

if spam == 10:
First if Block(
print('eggs'))

if spam > 5:
Second if Block(
print('bacon'))

else:
Third else block(
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam'))

8> Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans:
spam = 0
if spam == 1:
print('eggs')
if spam == 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('Greetings!')

9>If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ans: Ctrl +C

10> How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans : Break statement breaks the loop and continue statement skips the current iteration.

11> In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans : range(10) will list the elements from 0 -9 
range(3,10) will list from 3-9
range(0,10,2) will list numbers from 0,2,4,6,8

12>Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop

def print_numbers_from_one_to_10_using_for_loop():
    i=0
    for i in range(1,11):
        print (i)
        

def print_numbers_from_one_to_10_using_while_loop():
    i=0
    while i<=10:
        print (i)
        i+=1

13>If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans: This function can be called with spam.bacon().
